# ImagePrep
For Increased Automation of the initial steps of the ReImaging Process

Hello, Welcome If you are reading this then I don't know how, you must be a bot
this isn't really anything special just something i drove myself to do out of passion...

(Oh, and it also helps that it helped me understand some core principles of the Drive and Gmail APIs ^^)

All files here are marked with comments where needed :)

Don't go to hard on me, this is only the beginning for my software design path... 
Hopefully once i move into the harder courses and gain a better understanding of design patterns and algorithm complexities, 
I will only continue to improve...

All this is bundled into an exe using the very helpful Launch4j! :)
